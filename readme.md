# Welcome!

Hi! I’m a data scientist, and I built this site purely as a space for personal growth — to reflect real-world problems and explore data-driven ideas. I love experimenting with new methods, practicing what I learn, and turning curiosity into small but meaningful projects. This website is my sandbox to learn, test, and grow.

If you're someone who enjoys learning by doing and believes in the power of curiosity, you might find something inspiring here.

## 🔍 You can explore sample projects in topics like:

- 📊 **Machine Learning Models**  
- 🧠 **Large Language Models (LLMs) & Applications**  
- 🤖 **LLM Agent Development & Automation**  
- 🖼️ **Image Processing & Classification**  
- 🛠️ **Experimental Approaches to Real-World Problems**

**Happy exploring!**
